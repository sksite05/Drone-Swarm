# Drone Swarming Project

**Ongoing project to synchronize multiple drones autonomously using Python, Mission Planner, Pixhawk, and Raspberry Pi.**

## Features
- Built an F450 Pixhawk quadcopter from scratch with stable flight.
- Successfully completed an autonomous mission covering four waypoints at a 2-meter altitude.
- Currently synchronizing two drones for formations (horizontal and vertical lines) using a leader-follower approach.
- Future plans include scaling the approach to multiple drones.

## Requirements
- Pixhawk flight controller
- Raspberry Pi
- Mission Planner software
- Python 3.x

## Current Progress
- Test flights and calibration completed.
- completed autonomous waypoint navigation using mission planner of individual drones.
- Initial synchronization of two drones in progress.
- done the gazebo simulation of iris drones performing various swarms like square swarm, triangle swarm, check the simulation folder.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Drone-Synchronization.git
